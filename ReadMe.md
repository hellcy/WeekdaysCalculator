# MyBeepr Hoilday Challenge

This repository is an assignment to calculate weekdays between two given dates. Public hoildays in NSW need to be considered.

I first created an Android Application using Android Studio with Kotlin, set up a home page and a date picker. But I couldn't pass the date picker values to the main calculation function. This is where I stuck.

So I created a separate file named: HoildayTest.java. Which is a single file java program that will take user inputs to calculate weekdays between two given dates.

The Start Date and End Date should be given in the following format: yyyy MM dd

```
2021 1 15
2023 5 23
```
